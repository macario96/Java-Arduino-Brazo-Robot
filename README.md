# Java-Arduino-Brazo-Robot
You want to make a simple but gorgeous robot arm. You just need this program and some cheap materials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **DESCRIPTION**
Robotic arm made of cardboard. Cheaper and no need of buy expensive materials to build it.

The UI was made in java, the servomotors and step motor functions are in Arduino.
The purpose of the project is make a bridge between Java and Arduino to move the arm in many directions.
Also, make a grip what haves enough strenght to take objects and move them.

## **PROJECT MININUM REQUERIMENTS TO INSTALL THE LIBRARY FROM PANAMA HITECK**
* You must use the special library "PanamaHitek_Arduino-3.0.0.jar" to get the serial conection between Arduino and Java.
* To install it, just download the library and import to the project with the IDE import tool.

## **REQUERIMENTS TO USE THE PROGRAM**
* First, run the Arduino code, upload to the Arduino base to execute all hardware functions.
* After that, run the java Code. That shows the UI to control the arm.
* You can write 6 commands. If you input more than 6 commands, the program show a error messaje.
* You must buld correctly the arduino base.

## **FINAL BUILD**
